# 💪 SQUAD-76_PAWIN_WORKOUT_TRACKER – Smart Workout Tracker with RPE Monitoring

Welcome to **Smart Workout Tracker**, a web and mobile-friendly application designed to enhance your fitness journey by tracking your workouts, estimating your strength, and monitoring exertion levels using the RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) scale. 🏋️‍♀️📊

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

Modern fitness progress isn't just about lifting heavier — it's about lifting smarter. The **Workout Tracker** empowers users with detailed workout logging, real-time RPE input, and strength estimation tools to avoid overtraining and optimize performance.

The app offers:

- 📓 Log workouts with sets, reps, and weights  
- ⚖️ Rate exertion per set using the RPE scale (1–10)  
- 🧠 Auto-calculate estimated 1RM based on reps and RPE  
- 📈 Visual dashboard to monitor progress over time  
- 🕘 History log to view past sessions  
- 🔐 (Optional) User authentication for secure, personal tracking

## 🧾 API Endpoints (Backend)

The backend exposes the following workout-related routes. All endpoints under `/api/workouts` require a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`).

```http
POST /api/workouts          # create a new workout (body should contain exercises, duration, etc.; user is extracted from JWT)
GET  /api/workouts/user/:userId  # retrieve workouts for a specific user (supports query params `limit` and `skip`)
```  
*Both endpoints require a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header. Requests are scoped to the authenticated user.*

Use any HTTP client (curl, Postman) to exercise these routes. They demonstrate a database **write** (create) and **read** (fetch by user).

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

To keep your data safe and secure:

- Use `.env` files for sensitive variables  
```bash
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
